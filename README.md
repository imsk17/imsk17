### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sumit Kumar, a 20-year-old full-stack engineer exploring the world of open-source software and building some on the way.

I contribute to open source, and everything I build is available out in the open.

I'm a Gopher (ik ik, let the hate come.) and a Kotlin ðŸ…º fanatic, so you might find me making a lot of projects with them involved.

I also do some bloggin' at [imsk17.tech](https://imsk17.tech)

I'm currently (trying to) learn elixir, rescript.

I'm also available for part-time jobs, freelance work, or even full-time offers.
